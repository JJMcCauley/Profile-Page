Home Page

My current homepage, adapted from my capstone project for front end web development. Website is structured using the bootstrap framework and further styled and customized with scss. An embedded introduction has been added and the project list has been  updated to include new projects. JavaScript is used to populate the skills information based on what skill the mouse moved over and also to change the color theme.
